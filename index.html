    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p> WELCOME TO KALA KUTIRA ART GALLERY , MYSORE
        
        This collection is a celebration of visual expression — where colors, textures, and forms come together to tell stories beyond words.
        
        Each artwork is thoughtfully created to evoke emotion, spark imagination, and offer a fresh perspective. Inspired by elements of nature, memory, and abstract thought, the pieces blend traditional techniques with modern interpretations.
        
        The art explores themes such as stillness and movement, harmony and contrast, simplicity and complexity — inviting viewers to connect in their own unique way.
        
        Whether through bold strokes or subtle detail, every creation is designed to bring beauty, depth, and character to any space.
